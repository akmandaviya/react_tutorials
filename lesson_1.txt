BASIC INTRO:
------------

react is a library to build user interface.
react is a library build on js.
based on components(code resuability).
     -->by importing the component which are made earlier.
     -->we can use it any where in the application.
use to make SPA (single page application).
only for view(no mvc concepts),(model,view,controller)(view means UI).
react is fast due to use of virtual dom.
js,html,css all the concepts will be there in react.js
we will use JSx--> js extension syntax.


WHY REACT ?
-----------

-> react was introduced due to virtual dom , as it is fast.

Before that what is dom ?
    --> document object model
    -->we know document.getElementById("test").innerHTML="my name";
    -->what here?
      --> picks the elment by ID.
      --> destroys its children.
      --> add content
      --> add its children again.
      --> it picks the css styling if anything is there.
      --> after that is shows that that element on browser.
